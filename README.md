We're the Mario Brothers and plumbin's our game
We're not like the others who get all the fame
If your sink is in trouble, you can call us on the double
We're faster than the others, you'll be hooked on the brothers
Uh!

Hooked on the brothers!
Yigga-yigga, yigga-yigga

Yo, you're in for a treat so hang onto your seat
Get ready for adventure and remarkable feats
You'll meet Koopas, the Troopas, the Princess and the others
Hangin' with the plumbers, you'll be hooked on the brothers (To the bridge!)

Uh, uh

I say-a h-h-h-h-hooked on the brothers, the brothers, the brothers...
